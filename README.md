Description: The goal was to correctly recognize nine distinct activities performed during the Endotracheal Suctioning (ES) procedure. The dataset comprised skeletal point data, representing body joint positions, extracted from videos of nurses and nursing students. Various machine learning models, including LSTM and Random Forest, were tested, with XGBoost proving to be the most accurate. GANs were explored to augment the dataset by generating synthetic skeletal data, but this approach failed due to limited computational resources. The incomplete skeletal data and the small number of available training samples further contributed to reduced model accuracy.
